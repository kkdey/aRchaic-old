Title: Squared Extrapolation Methods for Accelerating EM-Like Monotone
    Algorithms
Description: Algorithms for accelerating the convergence of slow,
    monotone sequences from smooth, contraction mapping such as the EM
    algorithm. It can be used to accelerate any smooth, linearly
    convergent acceleration scheme.  A tutorial style introduction to
    this package is available in a vignette on the CRAN download page
    or, when the package is loaded in an R session, with
    vignette("SQUAREM").
